//! \brief Three layer model validation test. Depth averaged fields are gathered
//! on a gridded point mesh for subsequent post processing, namely velocity,
//! pressure and wind farm body force. The mesh must be cartesian and the vertical
//! direction is assumed to be the j-direction. The same hypothesis holds for the
//! ABL data acquisition, which performes spatial averages as a function of time
//! on the planes parallel to the wall defined by each cell's center.
