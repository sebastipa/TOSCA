## *Welcome to the repository of TOSVA*
*(Toolbox fOr Simulating Ventilation and Aerosols)*

TOSVA is a branch of [TOSCA](https://sebastipa.github.io/TOSCA/), an incompressible finite-volume large-eddy simulation code formulated in curvilinear coordinates 
with Boussinesq approximation to account for buoyancy. It features a moving immersed boundary method, synthetic turbulence generation through the Inverse Fourier method, and Eulerian particle tracking through the quadrature method of moments. It has been successfully used to simulate flow around a mannequin in a wind tunnel, human thermal plumes, and particle dispersion/deposition in a 1.8x1.77x1.9 meter air chamber. TOSVA is currently developed at the [Computational Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the University of British Columbia, Okanagan Campus](https://cfdlab.ok.ubc.ca/wind-farm-blockage-and-wake-effects/). 

We kindly ask you to *please* fill up [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUGtlHbCPfSI4-CO4bC9D4YsjcHis3Tu7UPTJeYqiB7BgCXA/viewform?usp=header) 
survey, which allows us to keep track of new TOSCA/TOSVA users around the world.

## User Guide

A large effort has been recently put in creating a comprehensive TOSCA user guide, which is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://sebastipa.github.io/TOSCA/). 
Although some chapters are still under construction, and a TOSVA specific user guide is yet to come, you can  already find instructions on how to install the code, a complete list of all input files and variables, together with their explanation,
as well as a step by step guide of some of the tutorials that are available on the repository under the `tests/` directory. We refer to these set of 
read-the-docs pages online as the main TOSCA user guide. 

An additional, temporary, user guide (which will soon become outdated) with a *TOSCA Getting Started* can be found inside `docs/` (*TOSCA_UserGuide.pdf*). 
For programmers, the code follows the *Doxygen* commenting style, so that a programmer's documentation is automatically generated by Doxygen. 
This can be found both inside `docs/` (*ReferenceManual.pdf*), or opened as a web documentation upon downloading the TOSCA repository and opening 
`docs/html/index.html`

## Reporting Bugs

For bugs, questions and to request modification to the TOSVA code, please open an issue GitHub. You can 
also contribute to the TOSCA code as explained [here](https://sebastipa.github.io/TOSCA/tosca_installation.html#contribute-to-the-tosca-project).
For different matters, please contact colechr@mail.ubc.ca. 

## Recent Highlights/Additions

 - Validated syntetic turbulence generator 
 - Validated Eulerian particle tracking through quadrature method of moments

## Executables

 - `tosca`    : transient solver for stratified incompressible flows. Temperature stratification is accounted via Boussinesq approximation.
 - `tosca2PV` : post processor for ParaView visualization. Writes data in XMF/HDF format.

## Future Implementations:

 - Infection risk models
