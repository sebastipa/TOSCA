TOSCA is an incompressible finite-volume large-eddy simulation code formulated in curvilinear coordinates 
with Boussinesq approximation to account for buoyancy. It features a moving immersed boundary method and several actuator 
models to include bodies and wind turbines within the simulation domain. Moreover, a two-way coupled overset mesh  
method has been introduced in the latest release, allowing to nest one or more refined regions within the main background domain. 

TOSCA has been successfully used to simulate atmospheric boundary layer and wind farm flows, including terrain and wind farm 
induced atmospheric gravity waves, cluster wakes, as well as 
wind farm control problems. TOSCA is currently developed at the `Computational Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the University of British Columbia, Okanagan Campus <https://cfdlab.ok.ubc.ca/wind-farm-blockage-and-wake-effects/>`_.

We kindly ask you to *please* fill up our `user survey <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUGtlHbCPfSI4-CO4bC9D4YsjcHis3Tu7UPTJeYqiB7BgCXA/viewform?usp=header>`_ , 
which allows us to keep track of new TOSCA users around the world.
