Example Cases
=============

This section describes some of TOSCA's example cases, which are contained in the ``tests/`` directory. Some test cases contain 
an empty ``inflowDatabase`` file, which is a placeholder for the inflow database. A sample database can be downloaded
`this <https://drive.google.com/file/d/17F5wtI5Jc1XGh8crmOVJYVXabC8iQXq1/view?usp=sharing>`_ link. After downloading it, 
simply substitute the ``inflowDatabase`` file with the downloaded directory. Notably, at the end of the 
:ref:`examples_neutral_abl_test`, an explanation is given on how to create these data on your own.
